;;; Commentary:
;;
;; mini-ontop-mode is a minor mode that prevents Emacs from scrolling the main
;; editing window when a multi-line minibuffer (e.g., icomplete-vertical)
;; appears. It automatically adjusts point just enough so that Emacs doesn't
;; force a jump in the visible buffer. Once the minibuffer session is complete,
;; point is restored if it hasn’t been moved manually by the user.
;;
;; Usage:
;;
;;   (require 'mini-ontop)
;;   (mini-ontop-mode 1)
;;
;; That’s it! With `mini-ontop-mode` enabled, your main buffer will no longer
;; jump when you press M-x or other commands that open multi-line minibuffers,
;; and there’s no extra configuration necessary.
;;
;; If you'd like to tweak its behavior, consult the code or customize the user
;; options. But for most people, the default settings “just work.”
